## 💡 About Me

I’m a dedicated IT professional with a strong foundation in cybersecurity and hands-on experience in technical support and systems management. My journey began in IT operations, where I developed practical skills in troubleshooting, system reliability, and user support — and evolved into a growing focus on cybersecurity as a discipline and passion.

I recently completed a Bachelor’s degree in Information Systems Technology, with a specialization in Cybersecurity, where I gained deep exposure to network defense, security frameworks, risk assessment, and incident response. Through academic projects, labs, and personal exploration, I’ve built practical experience with tools like Wireshark, Splunk, and Azure AD, while also strengthening my scripting and automation skills in Python and Bash.

My current focus is on threat detection, endpoint protection, vulnerability management, and building systems that are not only functional — but secure by design. I thrive in environments where problem-solving, continuous learning, and collaboration intersect to drive meaningful impact.

I'm always eager to connect with fellow professionals, share insights, and contribute to impactful cybersecurity initiatives that make systems smarter, safer, and more resilient.
